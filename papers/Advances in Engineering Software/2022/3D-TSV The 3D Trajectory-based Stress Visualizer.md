- 简介：We present the 3D Trajectory-based Stress Visualizer (3D-TSV), a visual analysis tool for the exploration of the principal stress directions in 3D solids under load. 3D-TSV provides a modular and generic implementation of key algorithms required for a trajectory-based visual analysis of principal stress directions, including the automatic seeding of space-filling stress lines, their extraction using numerical schemes, their mapping to an effective renderable representation, and rendering options to convey structures with special mechanical properties. In the design of 3D-TSV, several perceptual challenges have been addressed when simultaneously visualizing three mutually orthogonal stress directions via lines. We present a novel algorithm for generating a space-filling and evenly spaced set of mutually orthogonal lines. The algorithm further considers the locations of lines to obtain a more regular appearance, and enables the extraction of a level-of-detail representation with adjustable sparseness of the trajectories along a certain stress direction.
